# PyDataProcessTool
These are simple face images file analyzation tools written in python.
You can use them to do simple preprocess for your images samples for the subsequent machine learning task.
For example:
1.parse_plot_samples_distribution.py can parse and plot the labe distribution of your targets in the images folder.
2.create_train_validation_set.py can create train and validation or test set from your orignal images folder randomly or by user-defined rules
3.create_single_face_info_txt.py can create a txt containing the label information of the target in one image
